Verse 1
So many times,
It seems that life just longs to tear us down;
To clip our wings and drive us to the ground.
But I couldn’t even say
How many times
He’s picked me up and whispered “It’s alright,”
Then breathed my broken pieces back to life.
So believe me when I say;

CHORUS                          
There is hope when all seems hopeless.
There’s forgiveness when we fall.
There is joy within our suffering
Even when our faith is small.
There is grace beyond all measure
At the cross where Love stood tall.
‘Cause there is a God above it all

Verse 2
There are still times
When my heart is crippled by the weight of grief,
And my mind is filled with doubt and disbelief;
The lies tumble ‘round my head.
How many times
Must He remind me that His love will never fail?
That this momentary sorrow will not prevail?
It’s so easy to forget (that)

CHORUS                          
(That) There is hope when all seems hopeless.
There’s forgiveness when we fall.
There is joy within our suffering
Even when our faith is small.
There is grace beyond all measure
At the cross where Love stood tall.
‘Cause there is a God above it all

Bridge
Doesn’t matter the struggle you find yourself in;
When Christ is on your side, 
There’s no battle that you can’t win.
Just trust in Him—you can trust in Him.
Chorus 2  (Quiet half-chorus) 
He is greater than our weakness
He is stronger than our fear
He is perfect in his promise
He will wipe away our tears

Chorus 3 (Key Change up whole step)
He is hope when all seems hopeless.
He’s forgiveness when we fall.
He is joy when we are suffering.
He gives faith when ours is small.
He is love that lasts forever.
He will hear you when you call.
He is the God above it all.
He is the God above it all.
He is the God above it all.
