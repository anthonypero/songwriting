[Verse 1]
I fall before You on my knees
These trembling hands must soon let go
Before the God of grace release
My anxious heart, my wounded soul

[Verse 2]
I long to rest within your peace
I've fought this fight for far too long
The war must end, my struggles cease
I'm done pretending to be strong

[Chorus]
Still
I will be still before You now
You calm the chaos in my heart
Lord, You hold my world within Your hands
You've held it from the start

[Post-Chorus]
So I will be still and trust You God
I will be
Still

[Verse 3]
You echo in the quiet place
The space that I've been pouring out
You breathe Your Word, begin to trace
New life within my aching heart

[Chorus]
Still
I will be still before You now
You calm the chaos in my heart
Lord, You hold my world within Your hands
You've held it from the start

[Post-Chorus]
So I will be still and trust You God
I will be
Still

[Bridge]
When stormclouds form before my eyes
And wind and rain begin to rise
I'll empty out myself until
I hear You say to every wave...

[Chorus]
(Be) Still
I will be still before You now
You calm the chaos in my heart
Lord, You hold my world within Your hands
You've held it from the start

[Chorus]
Still
I will be still and wait on You
Until you fill my heart again
Let your living water overflow
A well that never ends

[Post-Chorus]
So I will be still and trust You God
I will be
Still

[Outro]
I will be
Still
I will be
Still
