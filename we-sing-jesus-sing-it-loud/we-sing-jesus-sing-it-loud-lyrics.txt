[Intro]

[Verse 1]
The sun breaks the dark as it climbs the sky
The shadows flee as your glories shine
Mountains tremble, the stars collide
Praises echo to the Most High

[Lift 1]
The heavens roar, all creation singing
With every breath, One name is ringing... 
  
[Chorus 1]
Sing it loud! Let the walls come down
Every voice! Let it shake the ground 
We sing Jesus, we sing Jesus 
Sing it loud! Let the heavens roar
Every heart! Let the praises soar
We sing Jesus, we sing Jesus
Sing it loud!

[Verse 2]
The stars declare what our words can’t say
Our voices rise to you anyway
All creation lifts You high
Chains now broken, hope alive

[Chorus 2]
Sing it loud! Let the walls come down
Every voice! Let it shake the ground 
We sing Jesus, we sing Jesus 
Sing it loud! Let the heavens roar
Every heart! Let the praises soar
We sing Jesus, we sing Jesus

[Bridge]
Sing it loud! (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Sing it loud! (Oh-oh, oh-oh)

[Lift 2]
The heavens roar, all creation singing
On every tongue, Hallelujahs ringing...

[Breakdown Chorus - Drums, hand claps, foot stomps]
Sing it loud! Let the walls come down
Every voice! Let it shake the ground 
We sing Jesus, we sing Jesus
[Add bass guitar]
Sing it loud! Let the heavens roar
Every heart! Let the praises soar
[Band begins to build]
We sing Jesus, we sing Jesus

[Chorus 2 - Full band]
Sing it loud! Let the walls come down
Every voice! Let it shake the ground 
We sing Jesus, we sing Jesus 
Sing it loud! Let the heavens roar
Every heart! Let the praises soar
We sing Jesus, we sing Jesus!

[Outro]
Sing it loud! (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
We sing Jesus, we sing Jesus 
Sing it loud (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
We sing Jesus, we sing Jesus
Sing it loud!
