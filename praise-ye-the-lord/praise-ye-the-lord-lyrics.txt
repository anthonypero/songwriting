[INTRO]

[VERSE 1]
Praise ye the Lord, O my soul, praise him with every breath
Praise ye the Lord, the One who upholds the widow and fatherless
Blessed is he whose help and hope comes from the Lord;
With justice and faithfulness, He reigns forevermore
Praise ye the Lord

[VERSE 2]
Praise ye the Lord, who heals broken hearts and calls the wounded His own
Praise ye the Lord, who numbers the stars, oh, tremble before Him, my soul
Great is the Lord, your God, whose power never fades
Hope in His steadfast love, He is the God who saves

[BRIDGE]
Praise ye the Lord, shining stars, moon, and sun
All you rivers that run to the sea
Praise ye the Lord, lift your voices as one
Rejoice in the Lord with me!

[VERSE 3]
Praise ye the Lord, O my soul, the One who set this prisoner free
Praise ye the Lord, stand and behold, the One who made your blind eyes see
Sing to the Lord, your God, a song of thanksgiving
Rejoice in his steadfast love, make music for the King
Praise ye the Lord, praise ye the Lord
