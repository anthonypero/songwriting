[Intro]

[Verse 1]
The Son of Man, crowned in thorns of love
Descended from His throne above
Hung on the cross to set us free
He wore our shame at Calvary

[Verse 2]
The Wounded King, ransom paid in full
Who took our place and bore the fall
Now reconciled by His blood
To become a child of God

[Pre-Chorus]
To become a child of God

[Chorus 1]
All to Jesus, King and Savior
We will raise our song to You
All to Jesus, King forever
All our days belong to You
All our days belong to You

[Verse 3]
Before Your throne, kneeling at Your feet
God, we surrender everything
Fill us with your love once more
Until we are wholly yours

[Pre-Chorus]
Jesus, we are wholly yours

[Chorus 2]
All to Jesus, King and Savior
We will raise our song to You
All to Jesus, King forever
All our days belong to You

[Chorus 1]
All to Jesus, King and Savior
We will raise our song to You
All to Jesus, King forever
All our days belong to You
All our days belong to You

Enthroned in glory, risen King
With one voice, all creation sings
Every crown, laid at Your feet
Our surrender, now complete

Enthroned in glory, risen King
With one voice, all creation sings
Every crown, laid at Your feet
Our surrender, now complete

Our surrender, now complete

We will raise our song to You
All to Jesus, King forever
All our days belong to You

All to Jesus, King forever
All our days belong to You
