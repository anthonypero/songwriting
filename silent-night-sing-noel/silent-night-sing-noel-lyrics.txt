Silent night holy night
All is calm all is bright
Round yon Virgin Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
Silent night holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia
Christ the Savior is born
Christ the Savior is born
He is born
Jesus is born hallelujah
Sing noel
Noel to our King to our Savior
Hallelujah
Silent night holy night
Son of God love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus Lord at Thy birth
Jesus Lord at Thy birth
He is born
Jesus is born hallelujah
Sing noel
Noel to our King to our Savior
He is born
Jesus is born hallelujah
Sing noel
Noel to our King to our Savior
He is born
Jesus is born hallelujah
Sing noel
Noel to our King to our Savior
Hallelujah
