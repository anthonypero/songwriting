[VERSE 1]

O God our help in ages past, 
our hope for years to come
Our shelter from the stormy blast 
and our eternal home

[INTRO]

[VERSE 2]
Before the hills in order stood 
or earth received her frame
From everlasting You are God 
to endless years the same

[CHORUS]
We trust You God, You are our portion
We dwell secure cause You never change
Though nations rise and fall before You
When all is dust, we still can trust
That Your Word remains

[VERSE 3]
A thousand ages in Your sight 
are like an evening gone
Short as the watch that ends the night 
before the rising sun

[VERSE 4]
O God our help in ages past, 
our hope for years to come
Be Thou our guide while life shall last 
and our eternal home

[CHORUS]
We trust You God, You are our portion
We dwell secure cause You never change
Though nations rise and fall before You
When all is dust, we still can trust
That Your Word remains

[BREAKDOWN CHORUS]
We trust you God, you are our portion
We dwell secure, cause you never change
Though nations rise and fall before You
When all is dust, we still can trust
That Your Word remains

When all is dust, we still can trust
That Your Word remains
