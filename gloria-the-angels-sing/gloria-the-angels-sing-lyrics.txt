[Intro]

[Verse]
Hark! the herald angels sing, 
"Glory to the newborn King; 
Peace on earth, and mercy mild, 
God and sinners reconciled!" 

[Lift]
Joyful, all ye nations rise, join the triumph of the skies; 
With the angelic host proclaim "Christ is born in Bethlehem!"

[Verse]
Christ, by highest heaven adored; 
Christ, the everlasting Lord; 
Late in time behold him come,
Offspring of a virgin's womb.  

[Lift]
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see; hail the incarnate Deity, 
Pleased with us in flesh to dwell, Jesus, our Emmanuel.

[Chorus]
Gloria! In excelsis deo
Gloria! To the one and only king
Gloria! Let our praise forever echo
We join the song of heaven and proclaim
Gloria!

[Verse]
Hail the heaven-born Prince of Peace!
Hail the Sun of Righteousness!
Light and life to all he brings,
Risen with healing in his wings.

[Lift]
Mild he lays his glory by, born that we no more may die,
Born to raise us from the earth, born to give us second birth

[Chorus]
Gloria! In excelsis deo
Gloria! To the one and only king
Gloria! Let our praise forever echo
We join the song of heaven and proclaim
Gloria!

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
Hark! the herald angels sing,
"Glory to the newborn King!"

[Chorus]
Gloria! In excelsis deo
Gloria! To the one and only king
Gloria! Let our praise forever echo
We join the song of heaven and proclaim

[Chorus]
Gloria! In excelsis deo
Gloria! To the one and only king
Gloria! Let our praise forever echo
We join the song of heaven and proclaim
Gloria!
