[Intro]

[Verse 1]
In the beginning the world was covered in darkness
Formless and void till the Lord  spoke one command
And the Word that he spoke made the darkness tremble before him
Light pierced the sky as the glory of God filled the land

[Link]

[Verse 2]
But the Darkness returned to cover the hearts of God’s children
Hopelessly burdened and torn by the weight of their sin
From the depths of despair, the People cried out for a Savior
The Lord heard their cry, and spoke forth the Word once again

[Chorus 1]
Light of the World, eternal flame
Our king forever, salvation is found in your name
[Post-Chorus]
You are the Light of the World

[Verse 3]
So the Word became flesh as you stepped from Your throne into darkness
To witness our sorrow and shame; to bear our disgrace
Justice demanded a price but we could not afford it
Like a lamb led to slaughter you offered yourself in our place

[Chorus]
Light of the World, eternal flame
Our king forever, salvation is found in your name
Despised and rejected, bearing our shame
Pierced and afflicted, yet healing is found in your name
[Post-Chorus]
You are the Light of the World

[Bridge]
You suffered and bled, then you rose from the dead 
To bring freedom
Light of all Men, shine your light once again
On your children
Pierce the darkness inside us once more

[Chorus]
Light of the World, eternal flame
Our king forever, salvation is found in your name
Despised and rejected, bearing our shame
Pierced and afflicted, yet healing is found in your name

[Chorus]
Risen, victorious — let all proclaim
Lord, you are for us — freedom is found in your name
Light of the World, eternal flame
Our king forever, salvation is found in your name
