[Intro]

[Verse]
O come, O come, Immanuel,
and ransom captive Israel
that mourns in lonely exile here
until the Son of God appear.

[Verse]
O come, O Wisdom from on high,
who ordered all things mightily;
to us the path of knowledge show
and teach us in its ways to go. 

[Chorus]
Rejoice! Rejoice! 
Immanuel
Shall come to you, 
O Israel.
Rejoice! Rejoice! 
Immanuel
Shall come to you, 
O Israel

[Verse]
O come, O Branch of Jesse's stem,
unto your own and rescue them!
From depths of hell your people save,
and give them victory o'er the grave. 

[Verse]
O come, O Key of David, come
and open wide our heavenly home.
Make safe for us the heavenward road
and bar the way to death's abode. 

[Chorus]
Rejoice! Rejoice! 
Immanuel
Shall come to you, 
O Israel.
Rejoice! Rejoice! 
Immanuel
Shall come to you, 
O Israel.

[Bridge]
On clouds of majesty
Now come victoriously
Order all things by your pow'r and might.
O Bright and Morning Star,
Bring us comfort from afar!
Transform the shadows of night into light.

[Chorus]
Rejoice! Rejoice! 
Immanuel
Shall come to you, 
O Israel.
Rejoice! Rejoice! 
Immanuel
Shall come to you, 
O Israel.

[Verse]
O come, O King of nations, bind
in one the hearts of all mankind.
Bid all our sad divisions cease
and be yourself our King of Peace

[Outro]
Our king of peace....
O come....
King of peace 
Come
