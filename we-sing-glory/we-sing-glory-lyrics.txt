[Verse 1]
The stars bow low and whisper Your name
The mountains rise and thunder the same
All creation cries, "You are glorified!"
You forever reign

[Verse 2]
Your love flows like a river untamed
Your mercy grows and will not be contained
Every knee will bow, every tongue proclaim
You forever reign, You forever reign

[Chorus]
We sing glory, glory 
to the Great I Am
We sing glory, glory 
to the Lion and the Lamb
We sing glory, glory 
to the Risen Son of Man
We sing glory
To you

[Verse 3]
An empty tomb, a stone rolled away
You were not there, you defeated the grave
Every giant falls at the sound of your name
You forever reign, you forever reign

[Chorus]
We sing glory, glory 
to the Great I Am
We sing glory, glory 
to the Lion and the Lamb
We sing glory, glory 
to the Risen Son of Man
We sing glory
To you

[Link]

[Bridge]
Every shadow recedes in the light of your face
Every sorrow redeemed by the work of your grace
You forever reign, you forever reign

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
We sing glory, glory

[Chorus]
We sing glory, glory 
to the Great I Am
We sing glory, glory 
to the Lion and the Lamb

to the Risen Son of Man
