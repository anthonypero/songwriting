Joy to the world! The Lord is come
Let earth receive her King
Let every heart prepare Him room
And heaven and nature sing

And heaven, and heaven,

While fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains
Repeat the sounding joy

A joyful song of praise to the newborn king
Let every voice on the earth proclaim
That Christ is born this day in Bethlehem
