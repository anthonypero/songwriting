[Intro]

[Verse]
Don't know where I'm walking
Don't know where to turn
Though I try my dreams they still pursue

[Lift]
Ever on I go, pretending not to see
The cracks in my facade
That soon betray

[Chorus]
Where can I turn
To hide me from the pain
A place where none can see
The me inside of me
Where I can finally be free of me?

[Verse 2]
Nights spent restlessly
As demons haunt my side
Can't evade the strain of doubt within

[Lift]
Ever on I go, pretending not to see
The cracks in my facade
That soon betray

[Chorus 2]
Where can I turn
To hide me from my pain
A place where I can run
Where I can be undone?
Where can I turn
To hide me from my shame
A place where none can see
The me inside of me
Where I can truly be free of me

[Bridge]
I know now there's nothing I can do
To change somehow
The things I've put me through
But I believe the path lies somewhere
Ahead of me

[Verse 3]
I need You to open up the way
Guide me toward the 
Fields of grace

[Lift ]
Change this heart within, take away my fear
Let me know that You are 
Truly here

[Chorus 3]
And I will turn to You
Into Your arms I will subside
A place where I can be whole
Secure and free
Yes I will turn to You
Into Your arms of loving grace
You'll open up the door
Show me what I've been searching for
A place where I can be
Where only You shine fully through
Through me
