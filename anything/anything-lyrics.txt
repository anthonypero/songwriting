Anything (You Need to Say to Me)
Anthony Pero



VERSE 1           
Is there anything—
Is there anything you need to say to me?
Is there something on your mind,
Hidden just behind the heartache in your eyes?
Do I dare to dream—
Do I dare to dream that you would finally speak?
The truth we’ve always known
Or have you grown dependent on a lie?


CHORUS 1
Is there anything that you need to say to me?
Is there anything that you need to say to me?


VERSE 2  
Is there anything—
Is there anything you want to let me know?
                         C             
Hidden deep within your heart
                             Em7                                             F                                    Gsus
Is there a spark, an ember that still yearns to live?
                     Am7  
Do you dare to dream—
                     Am7/G                                                                      D/F# - Dm/F
Do you dare to dream beyond the afterglow?
                          C                    
Past the lies your heart has learned?
                                 Gsus                                                              C
Or has that fire burn too brightly to forgive?

Is there anything that you need to say—

Time doesn’t care that you were caught unaware
                C             G/B                       Am 
The river of life rushes on

Revelation is rare so seize what you dare

Cause in a moment, the moment will be gone
